📄 Plagiarism Checker
✨ Overview

This project is a Plagiarism Checker implemented using Python. It allows users to compare text documents and determine the level of similarity between them. This is useful for academic writing, content creation, and research where originality of work is critical.

🚀 Features

    🔹 Detects similarity between multiple text files or inputs
    🔹 Provides a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity or other metrics)
    🔹 Works with multiple document formats
    🔹 Handles preprocessing like tokenization, stop-word removal, and normalization
    🔹 Generates reports for plagiarism percentage

📂 Project Structure

    🔹 Plagiarism_checker.ipynb → Main notebook containing implementation and demonstrations
    🔹 data/ → Sample dataset or text files for testing plagiarism (if included)
    🔹 results/ → Output reports or similarity results (optional)

🛠️ Technologies Used

    🔹 Python (Core language)
    🔹 NumPy & Pandas (data handling)
    🔹 Jupyter Notebook (development & testing environment)

📖 How It Works

    🔹 Input Documents: User provides one or more text documents.
    🔹 Preprocessing: Text is cleaned, tokenized, and normalized.
    🔹 Vectorization: Documents are converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
    🔹 Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity or another metric is applied.
    🔹 Output: A plagiarism score is generated, showing how similar documents are.

⚡ Use Cases

    🔹 Academic Institutions: Checking student assignments and reports
    🔹 Content Writers: Ensuring originality before publishing
    🔹 Researchers: Validating research papers for unique contributions
